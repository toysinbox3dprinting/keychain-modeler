# To use create-react-app with typescript template
with combination of normal ESM modules as well as commonjs (i.e. custom library),
one must configure the babel configs that react-scripts uses to transpile 
the typescript/javascript output to accept "multiple module schemes". To do this:

1) Open /node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js

2) Go to the babel-loader config options and add the code:

sourceType: "unambiguous"

to the config object.

3) Transpiling should now output valid modules to run in the browser. 

4) Note that Typescript output/module is "commonjs" and target is "ES2016".



# For the exported page to work on a subpath under index ("/") such as "/hellomunchkin-2023",
one must perform the following changes:

1) Open /package.json and add the code:

"homepage": "/hellomunchkin-2023/"

to the JSON object. Note that this is an absolute (?) path, not a relative.

2) Navigate to "App.tsx" (whever the React base app is). Normally, the router interprets "/"
but we need to change it to the following code (or an equivalent):

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/hellomunchkin-2023",
    element: (<HomePage></HomePage>),
  },
]);

which will allow us to put our files in the correct subdirectory and things will run as expected.
